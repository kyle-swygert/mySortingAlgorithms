# mySortingAlgorithms
Sorting algorithms rewritten for practice and learning. 
Notes on each Algorithm's Big-O efficiency (time and space), stability, best use cases and more will be included with each file. 
Create a main class or test class that will test all of the sorting algorithms in the project. Time each of the executions and display when testing has finished.
